To use the code input the file being used as a parameter arg (so pass "employee-sample.csv" as an argument when running the program) and it should do prompt A correctly.  
I have noticed that there is a slight issue being that when copy pasting the prompt from the pdf it breaks (I believe it is because of some weird quotation marks on the doc) so I have included the prompt typed out below because it works whenever I type out the prompt instead of pasting  
  
Search for and list the names of all employees who work in the same department as "Johnson Jared" - himself excluded  
  
I attempted to fix the problem with the weird quotation marks in the code but there is still some problems with it when just replacing them out for normal quotation marks so I have no idea what the problem is but when using the typed out version it works so I gave up on fixing that part.
